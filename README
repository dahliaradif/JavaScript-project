A JavaScript program that allows users to click and drag to create circles, and fits an optimal circle based on user selected gridpoints. 

Getting started:
1. Run main.html in a suitable browser, e.g. Google Chrome
2. Click 'Part 1' for the click and drag circle functionality. NOTE: This will hide the Generate button.
3. Click 'Part 2' for fitting an optimal circle based on selected points.
4. Click 'Reset' once 'Part 1' or 'Part 2' have been clicked to repeat the same functionality, 
	e.g. redraw a circle, or reselect points. 
5. Click reset before switching to Part 1 or Part 2. 
6. Clicking the 'Part 1' or 'Part 2' buttons will automatically reset the page so that the two functionalities 
	do not overlap. 

The code was extensively tested by dragging and drawing in different directions and different center coordinates. 
The 'generate' button was also tested by continously resetting and selecting different points and observing the fit circle.
